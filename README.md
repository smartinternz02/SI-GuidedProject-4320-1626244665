Urban water quality is of great importance to our daily lives. Prediction of urban water quality help control water pollution and protect human health . In this work, we forecast the water quality of a station over the next few hours, using a multitask, multi-view learning method to fuse multiple datasets from different domains. In particular, our learning model comprises two alignments . The first alignment is the space-temporal view alignment, which combines local spatial and temporal information of each station. The second alignment is the prediction alignment among stations, which captures their spatial correlations and performs co-predictions by incorporating these correlations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
